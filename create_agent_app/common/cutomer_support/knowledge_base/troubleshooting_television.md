**Document 2: Pixelation or Fuzzy Picture – Troubleshooting Steps**

**Issue:** Experiencing a pixelated or fuzzy picture quality on your TV.

**Possible Causes:**

*   **Weak Signal:** The incoming signal may be weak due to issues with the cable connection or external factors.
*   **Loose Cables:** Loose or damaged cables can degrade the signal quality.
*   **Splitters:** Too many splitters in the cable line can weaken the signal.
*   **Weather Conditions:** Severe weather can sometimes affect the signal.
*   **Set-Top Box Issues:** The set-top box may be malfunctioning.

**Troubleshooting Steps:**

1.  **Check the Cables:**
    *   Ensure all cables connecting the set-top box to the TV and the wall are securely plugged in. Replace any damaged cables.

2.  **Check the Coaxial Cable Connection:**
    *   Make sure the coaxial cable (the round cable that connects to the wall) is securely connected to the set-top box.

3.  **Bypass Splitters:**
    *   If you are using any splitters in the cable line, try bypassing them by connecting the coaxial cable directly from the wall to the set-top box.
    *   If the picture quality improves, the splitter may be the problem. Replace it with a high-quality splitter or remove it altogether if it is not needed.

4.  **Restart the Set-Top Box:**
    *   Unplug the set-top box from the power outlet.
    *   Wait 60 seconds.
    *   Plug the set-top box back in and wait for it to power on fully.

5.  **Check Weather Conditions:**
    *   If the pixelation or fuzziness started during or after a severe storm, the issue may be due to weather-related interference. The problem may resolve itself once the weather clears.

6.  **Contact XPTO Telecom Technical Support:**
    *   If you have tried all of the above steps and the picture quality is still poor, contact XPTO Telecom Technical Support at 555-123-4567.
